title: "A DSL for Network Specification"
---

We aim to design a high-level, declarative specification of network connectivity
for use in simulations of morphologically detailled neurons. In particular, such
a description should take the form of a domain-specific language (DSL) and an
implementation in Arbor [1]. The project includes a study of the design space
and prior art [eg 2, 3], as well as the use of connectivity rules in existing
simulators and the requirements of neuro-scientists. From this a model should be
developed that captures practical users' needs while building upon a composable
structure.
