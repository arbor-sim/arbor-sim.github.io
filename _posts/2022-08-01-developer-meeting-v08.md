title: Developer meeting v0.8
---

The next **Arbor release, v0.8** is planned in the week of **19 September 2022**.

The next **developer meeting** is planned for **30 August 2022**, from **10:00-13:00 CEST**. The meeting will be held [here](https://webconf.fz-juelich.de/b/hui-clp-qgu-ypp); downloadable as [ICS file](/next-dev-meet.ics). Any changes to the scheduling of this meeting will be advertised here and through our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/arbor-sim/community).

Like last time, in this meeting, a list of features ([see "Next Release" column](https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/3)) is proposed for delivery in the next release. The Developer Meeting is the right place to make your own priorities known, and any [filed Issues](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues) can be added for inclusion in the next (or later) release. Please do join if you have research that depends on the delivery of features in Arbor, or if you're interested in Arbor development! If you'd like to bring anything to our attention in the meeting, make sure it's [filed as an issue](/how-to-file-an-issue).

[Our Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/3) lets you follow all of this outside of the developer meetings. At a glance you can see what's cooking in Arbor. We use Github's Milestone feature to plan Issues for specific releases, so with time, the [Milestone overview](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/milestones) will give you some insight in what's planned for and already merged in Arbor.

Hope to see you there!
