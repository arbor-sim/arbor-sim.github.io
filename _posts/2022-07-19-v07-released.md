title: "v0.7 released!"
---

Version v0.7 has been released! This is the second version released in [our 3 month release cadence](https://docs.arbor-sim.org/en/latest/contrib/release.html#release-cycle), although it has been delayed a bit due to some problems and eventual significant improvements to the (Python) build system. Our `setup.py` is now nearly empty, and all instructions live in `pyproject.toml` and Python MacOS wheels come with ARM support. Details of this release can be found [here](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/releases/tag/v0.7). The release is out on PyPI as well, so give it a go:

```
python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
pip install arbor
python -c 'import arbor; print(arbor.__config__)'
```

Should you encounter any problems, [don't hesitate to let us know](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/new/choose).

For the next release, we'll be having a developers meeting in preparation, where anyone is welcome to hear about and give input on version v0.8. This meeting will be in late august; a more precise announcement will follow.
