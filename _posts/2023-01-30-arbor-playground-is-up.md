title: Arbor Playground is up
---

As of today the [Arbor-playground is online](https://arbor-sim.org/playground/). The Playground is a version of Arbor compiled to the web, through [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) and [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org). This means you can take Arbor for a test drive right in your browser, without having to install anything. The Playground comes preloaded with a few models, we're still working on you being able to load them yourself.

Take a look at [arbor-sim.org/playground](https://arbor-sim.org/playground) and let us know what you think!
