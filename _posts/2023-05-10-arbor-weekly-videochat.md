title: Arbor weekly videochat
---

For the past months we've had a weekly public-ish meeting with some modelers. Today we announce that this meeting is now open to all! Every **Wednesday 13:00 CET** we convene in the Arbor Community channel on Gitter to have a videochat for an hour of questions, answers, demonstrations, anything related to Arbor really. Please join if you're interested in sharing your work, getting help or just getting an idea of what's going on in our community.

You can join [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/arbor-sim/community) or through [a Matrix client](https://matrix.to/#/#arbor-sim_community:gitter.im).

You can [add the meeting to your agenda by clicking here](/weekly-meet.ics).
