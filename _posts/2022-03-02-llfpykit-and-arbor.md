title: LFPykit and Arbor
---

The second Arbor Developer Meeting has just concluded, and was again a great success! Please find the minutes [here](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor-materials/blob/master/minutes/devmeets/) and have a look at the Milestone overview to see what's coming in next next release(s): [Milestone overview](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/milestones). v0.7 is planned for release on 2 May.

Also, today Arbor v0.6 is featured on the [Ebrains.eu website](https://ebrains.eu/news/arbor-neural-network-simulation-library-gets-an-update/).

In the Developer Meeting, Arbor users shared some of their work, and we'd like to highlight a particular one, because it is a movie and movies are slick. It showcases Arbor and [LFPykit](https://lfpykit.readthedocs.io). Not long ago, we've received a tutorial on this subject: how to extract extracellular potentials from Arbor and analyze and visualize them using LFPykit. You can find the tutorial [in the Arbor documentation](https://docs.arbor-sim.org/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial_lfpykit.html).

The showcase is generated with [this notebook](https://github.com/llandsmeer/iopublic/blob/main/Local%20field%20potential%20v2.ipynb), and show LFP measurements in a z-slice of a morphological and biophysical realistic model of the inferior olivary nucleus (left PO) under small GABA input. The demo was created by Lennart Landsmeer, student at the [Neuro Computing Lab](https://neurocomputinglab.com/research-team/), Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who are part of our [ArborIO collaboration](/collaboration). Enjoy!
