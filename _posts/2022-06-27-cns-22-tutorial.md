In addition to a poster presentation, Arbor is present with a satellite workshop at this years edition of the CNS conference. After an introduction to Arbor and an overview of recent new features and ongoing work, we'll step through a tutorial creating an example cell and network.

More info about this workshops and others are found [here](https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/pages/software-wg-satellite-tutorials-at-cns-2022.html). You'll also find the signup form there.
