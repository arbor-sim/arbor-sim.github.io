## Who uses it?

Arbor applications have so far been focused primarily on synthetic verification, testing and performance benchmarks
(see <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07454> for details).
However, it is planned to increase the user base within the next three years by preparing user-defined cellular
-level models for portable HPC simulations using Arbor across a variety of current and emerging supercomputing
resources through a Call for Expression of Interest (not open yet, check out <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/collaborate/open-calls/> 
for updates).
Expert computational neuroscientists from both outside and inside the Human Brain Project (HBP) are invited to
develop models and adapt workflows for Arbor, specifically for networks of detailed cell models that require HPC (<https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor>).
