## Where do I get it?

Arbor is developed by the Swiss National Supercomputing Center and the Jülich Supercomputing Center under the
auspices of the HBP as an active open source project, developed using an open-development model with code, 
continuous integration, bug reports and issues hosted on GitHub: <https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor>.
Benchmarking and validation of Arbor and other simulators can be performed with the NSuite performance and validation
testing suite (<https://nsuite.readthedocs.io>, <https://github.com/arbor-sim/nsuite>).
