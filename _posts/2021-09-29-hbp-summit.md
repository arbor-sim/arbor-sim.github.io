Arbor is present at the Human Brain Project Summit 2021, held October 12-15. We've submitted the same poster as to Bernstein 2021, due to proximity of the events. In case you missed it, the poster describes the reproduction of [Uncertainty Propagation in Nerve Impulses Through the Action Potential Mechanism](https://doi.org/10.1186/2190-8567-5-3) by Valderrama et al. The reproduction is a Hodgkin-Huxley sensitivity analysis using Arbor and [SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io) and was [kindly contributed by Sebastian Schmitt](https://github.com/arbor-contrib/hodgkin-huxley-sensitivity-analysis).

The poster is available in [our own repository](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor-materials/blob/master/presentations/bernstein2021_poster/main.pdf).
