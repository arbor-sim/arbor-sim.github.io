# From Atoms to Neuronal Spikes: A Multiscale Simulation Framework

https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01793

From the abstract: 

Understanding how molecular events in ion channels impact neuronal excitability,
as derived from the calculation of the time course of the membrane potentials,
can help elucidate the mechanisms of neurological disease-linked mutations and
support neuroactive drug design. Here, we propose a multiscale simulation
approach which couples molecular simulations with neuronal simulations to
predict the variations in membrane potential and neural spikes.
