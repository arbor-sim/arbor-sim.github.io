title: "GUI v0.8 released!"
---

With the release of Arbor v0.8 we plan to co-release Arbor and Arbor GUI. It took a bit longer than anticipated to get the generation of the Linux AppImage and MacOS Disk Image back in working state, but we succeeded :) At this time we do not have a MacOS image for the Apple Arm architecture, but on this platform you can build the Arbor GUI yourself.

With the v0.8 release of Arbor GUI, you're getting [all the goodies of Arbor v0.8](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/releases/tag/v0.8). Please find the code and ready-made executables [here](https://github.com/arbor-sim/gui/releases/tag/v0.8).
