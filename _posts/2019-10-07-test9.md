## Is it suitable for me?

Use Arbor if you have the need to run your detailed cellular-level model in an efficient manner; Arbor has been
designed to become an order of magnitude more efficient both in terms of solution times and memory usage as compared
to existing simulation engines, without sacrificing ease of use and flexibility (see <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07454> 
for details). 
Full support for the SONATA model exchange format is under active development, and Arbor will also provide APIs for
integration with other tools and simulators, including co-simulation with NEST (<https://www.nest-simulator.org>) 
mediated via spike exchange for large, multi-scale brain simulations, and participation in orchestrated simulation, 
analysis and visualization applications with NEST, Elephant (<http://neuralensemble.org/elephant/>), TVB (<https://www.thevirtualbrain.org>) 
and other tools using the HBP in-situ pipeline (<https://hbp-hpc-platform.fz-juelich.de/?hbp_software=in-situ-pipeline>).
