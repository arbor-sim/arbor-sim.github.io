Arbor is present at the Bernstein 2021 conference, held 21-23 September. We contributed poster 84 describing the reproduction of [Uncertainty Propagation in Nerve Impulses Through the Action Potential Mechanism](https://doi.org/10.1186/2190-8567-5-3) by Valderrama et al. The reproduction is a Hodgkin-Huxley sensitivity analysis using Arbor and [SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io) and was [kindly contributed by Sebastian Schmitt](https://github.com/arbor-contrib/hodgkin-huxley-sensitivity-analysis).

The poster is available in the [Bernstein poster repository](https://bc.g-node.org/BernsteinConference/Posters/src/master/posters/84.pdf) (accesible only for attendees) or [our own repository](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor-materials/blob/master/presentations/bernstein2021_poster/main.pdf).

We are also present during the SLNS and EBrain German National Node booths describing current developments around Arbor.
