## Abstract

Arbor is a library for simulating biophysically detailed neuron models on modern
hardware. It comes with a friendly Python interface hiding its blazingly fast
C++ core; scaling from laptops to at least 4000 GPUs. In this tutorial, we will
show you the basics of designing detailed cell models, how to run them using
Arbor, and how to grow them into larger networks. We will demonstrate how to
create data driven models using the Allen Brain Atlas as an example. Arbor is
free and open-source software, developed in the Human Brain Project and EBRAINS.
