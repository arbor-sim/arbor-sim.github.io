title: "A DSL for Network Specification"
categories: projects

We aim to design a high-level, declarative specification of network connectivity
for use in simulations of morphologically detailled neurons. In particular, such
a description should take the form of a domain-specific language (DSL) and an
and prior art [2, 3, 4], as well as the use of connectivity rules in existing
implementation in Arbor [1]. The project includes a study of the design space
simulators and the requirements of neuro-scientists. From this a model should be
developed that captures practical users' needs while building upon a composable
structure.

We are estimating this to be a Master's project, but depending on the candidate
this could be changed as needed. A background in neuroscience, especially in
modelling, and experience with other simulation tools is helpful. We require a
working knowledge of C++. If you are interested, please get in touch.
