## How do I work with it?

Arbor is installed by obtaining the source code from GitHub (<https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor>) and compiling it
on the target system (for detailed information visit <https://arbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>).
Arbor provides both a low level C++ API and a higher level Python API (under development):

-   The C++ API provides full control over Arbor simulations, and may be required for tightly integrated simulations
    or scenarios where efficiency at scale is paramount (visit <https://arbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp_intro.html>
    for more details).

-   The Python API is expected to be the most commonly used interface for computational neuroscientists 
    (visit <https://arbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_intro.html> for more details).
